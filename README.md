# Extension GitHub integration

## About

This extension integrates Version Control Systems (VCSs), such as GitHub, with iTop. Based on events triggered by
repositories hosted on VCSs, it runs user-defined automations that transfer valuable and relevant information linked to
these repositories directly to iTop objects such as tickets or CIs.

The extension may be used in conjonction with **Software and Release management** or any other extension that deals with
source code repositories.

## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the
best way to get a running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you
will miss additional modules.
